## Count Factors
A positive integer D is a _factor_ of a positive integer N if there exists an integer M such that N = D * M.

For example, 6 is a factor of 24, because M = 4 satisfies the above condition (24 = 6 * 4).

Write a function:

```python
def solution(N)
```

that, given a positive integer N, returns the number of its factors.

For example, given N = 24, the function should return 8, because 24 has 8 factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. There are no other factors of 24.

Write an **efficien**t algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

## Min Perimeter Rectangle
An integer N is given, representing the area of some rectangle.

The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length A and B is A * B, and the perimeter is 2 * (A + B).

The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N. The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.

For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:
```
(1, 30), with a perimeter of 62,
(2, 15), with a perimeter of 34,
(3, 10), with a perimeter of 26,
(5, 6), with a perimeter of 22.
```
Write a function:

```python
def solution(N)
```

that, given an integer N, returns the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area is exactly equal to N.

For example, given an integer N = 30, the function should return 22, as explained above.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
